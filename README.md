IMPORTANT NOTICE: READ THIS BEFORE CLICKING THE LINK

The link above will take you to my Replit page.

There, you'll find a folder/app called 100 Days of Code. To access it:

Click on the Remix buttonâ€”this will give you access to my app.
Inside the app, you'll find multiple files/projects, documenting my programming journey from Day 1 to Day 100.
If you don't see the files right away, click on the file icon on the left to display the full list of projects.
Double-click on any file to open it.

-How to Run a File
Rename the file you want to run to main.py (or just main, since Replit automatically adds the .py extension).
Then, click Run to execute the code.
Note :
Before switching to a different file, rename it back to its original name, then change the next file you want to run to main.py.

Also, you cannot have more than one file named main.py at the same time. If you do, the code won't execute, and Replit will block the action automatically.

Furthermore, always ensure you rename the files before and after execution to keep everything organized.
