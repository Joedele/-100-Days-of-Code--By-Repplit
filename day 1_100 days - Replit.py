I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!🥳 🥳
I will make sure to spend some time everyday coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE, so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!😂😂
I am feeling 😊😊
